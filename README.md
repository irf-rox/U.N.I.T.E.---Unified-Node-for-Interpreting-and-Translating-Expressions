# 💡 U.N.I.T.E. — **Unified Node for Interpreting and Translating Expressions**

> Empowering the differently-abled through inclusive communication technologies

---

## 📖 Overview

**U.N.I.T.E.** is a multi-phase accessibility tool designed to bridge the communication gap between **visually impaired** and **hearing impaired** individuals and the rest of the world.

In a world where information access and communication are critical, UNITE addresses the pain points of:

* The **slow, bureaucratic process** of Braille document generation,
* The **inaccessibility** of sign language to non-signers,
* And the **exclusion** of visually impaired individuals from fast, digital communication.

This unified platform supports:

* 🔡 **Text to Braille**
* 🧏 **Sign Language to Text**
* 🧏‍♂️ **Sign Language to Braille**
* 🔊 **Text to Speech**
* 🧾 **Audio to Braille**
* ✍️ (Coming soon) **Handwritten Text to All Phases**

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* **Instant Braille Conversion**: Skip long wait times and bureaucracy. Input text, get tactile output.
* **Sign Language Recognition**: Convert hand gestures into real-time text using computer vision and ML.
* **Speech Output**: Converts detected text to speech for seamless audio interaction.
* **Arduino-Powered Braille Printer**: A compact, 6-servo module that embosses Braille in real-time.
* **Custom Model Training**: Train your own dataset with a few commands.

## 🔧 Setup Instructions

### 🧠 Software Requirements

Install dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Libraries used:

* `opencv-python`
* `mediapipe`
* `pyfirmata`
* `gtts`
* `playsound`
* `scikit-learn`
* `numpy`

### 🦾 Arduino Braille Bot

The **UNITE Braille Bot** runs on:

* Arduino UNO
* 6x SG90 Micro Servo motors
* Powered by a 9V battery

#### 🔌 Circuit Details

* Servo VCC ➝ Breadboard +ve rail
* Servo GND ➝ Breadboard -ve rail
* Servo Signal ➝ Arduino digital pins: **8–13**
* Battery GND ➝ Breadboard -ve rail
* Breadboard -ve ➝ Arduino GND (important!)

> 📌 *Pins can be reconfigured in `signlang.py` (lines 12–17)*

## 🧪 How to Run

### 🖐 From Scratch (Custom Dataset)

1. **Capture Hand Gestures**
   Run the following to capture 100 samples per gesture:

   ```bash
   python collect_imgs.py
   ```

2. **Create Dataset**

   ```bash
   python create_dataset.py
   ```

3. **Train the Classifier**

   ```bash
   python train_classifier.py
   ```

4. **Start the Recognizer Interface**

   ```bash
   python signlang.py
   ```

   This opens the webcam interface. Show hand gestures, and the system will:

   * Detect sign language
   * Convert to text
   * Speak the word (via TTS)
   * Send character commands to Braille bot via Arduino

---

## 🧠 Under the Hood

* **MediaPipe**: For real-time hand landmark detection.
* **OpenCV**: Camera handling and gesture capture.
* **Random Forest**: Fast, reliable classification for hand gestures.
* **Arduino + PyFirmata**: Communicates gestures to servo motors.
* **gTTS + playsound**: Converts recognized text into speech audio.

---

## 🧭 Roadmap / Future Phases

* ✍️ **Handwritten Text Detection** (In Progress)
* 📱 Android App Integration
* ☁️ Cloud Accessibility API
* 🧠 LLM Integration for Smart Text Conversion
* 📊 Dashboard for Visual and Accessibility Analytics

---

## 💡 Why It Matters

Accessibility should not be an afterthought — it's a right. UNITE provides:

* 🔓 **Autonomy** to differently-abled individuals
* 📚 **Access** to information at par with others
* 🔁 **Bidirectional communication** between the hearing, sighted, and differently abled
* ⚙️ **Customizability** for any language, region, or use-case
